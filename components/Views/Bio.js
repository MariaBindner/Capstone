<h3>About Me</h3>

The author of this work was in a support role for over twenty years.  All things being equal, submitting group orders/catering orders, on time, accurate and organized was very difficult to do.  Hoping this solution takes away the complexity for group/catering orders.  All the best - now Order Up!
